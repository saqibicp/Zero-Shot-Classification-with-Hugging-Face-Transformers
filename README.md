# Zero-Shot-Classification-with-Hugging-Face-Transformers
This project demonstrates zero-shot classification using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It classifies text sequences into predefined categories without prior training on those specific categories.

# Overview:
The script utilizes the pipeline function from the transformers library to perform zero-shot classification on given text sequences. It generates bar plots to visualize the classification scores for different candidate labels.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
Transformers
NumPy
Matplotlib

# Installation:
1. git clone "https://github.com/saqibicp/Zero-Shot-Classification-with-Hugging-Face-Transformers.git"
2. Install the Requirements by using Pip install tranformers, numpy, matplotlib
3. Run the Notebook Cells
